# Trade-Tracker
The purpose of 'Trade tracker' is to keep a log of all stock trades done

Info stored:
<br/>   *Date of trade
<br/>   *Time of trade
<br/>   *Stock name
<br/>   *Net value of trade
  
The information is stored inside of a Derby database and displayed through a GUI built in JavaFX using the Gluon Scene Builder.

The GUI is simple and acts as expected. Each Text Field prompts you with the correct entry format, and all buttons display their function.
The Table takes up enough of the Scene to display all columns of data.
The table also sorts as expected by clicking the arrows next to the Column Label.
