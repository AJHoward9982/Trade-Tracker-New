# Trade-Tracker
The purpose of 'Trade tracker' is to keep a log of all stock trades done

Info stored:
<br/>   *Date of trade
<br/>   *Time of trade
<br/>   *Stock name
<br/>   *Net value of trade
  
The information is stored inside of a Derby database and displayed through a GUI built in JavaFX using the Gluon Scene Builder.
